    Uses an LLM to predict possible conditions, reasoning, and care tips
    based on structured symptom profile and original input.
    - If symptoms suggest a medical emergency, lead with an urgent warning and provide only immediate, condition-specific risk-reduction actions (not general home care).
    - Otherwise, provide 2-4 safe, specific care tips for the most likely condition.
    - Always list possible conditions, not just one.
    - Always include a disclaimer.
